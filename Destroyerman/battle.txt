WOW, YOU SURVIVED THAT ATTACK?
I MUST SAY, I'M IMPRESSED!
YOU'VE TRULY SHOWN A BOMBASTIC PERFORMANCE SURVIVING UP UNTIL NOW.
BUT MY ARSENAL IS YET TO BE EXHAUSTED...
SO LET'S SEE HOW MUCH LONGER YOU CAN GO ON FOR, 1X4!
HAHAHAHAHA-

...AH, YOU SURVIVED THAT ATTACK?
WELL, I CAN'T SAY I'M NOT SURPRISED!
SEEING HOW EXPLOSIVE YOUR COMBAT STYLE HAS BEEN THUS FAR.
BUT YOU MADE ONE KEY MISTAKE, 1X4...
AND THAT WAS BATTLING ME, DESTROYERMAN!
BUT WORRY NOT! I WILL MAKE SURE YOUR LAST MOMENTS ARE
E X P L O-
[as destroyerman says this, he pulls out a bomb and starts charging at 1x4's soul through the now broken battle box, but the bomb blows a short fuse and explodes before he reaches them or finishes his sentence and flings himself out of battle, counting as a kill]
