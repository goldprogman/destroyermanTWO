pacifist
- you stop him from exploding/flinging himself and friend him
neutral
- he flings himself out of battle before you friend him or either of you defeat each other and then he just causes havoc elsewhere
genocide
- you whittle him down to a tiny sliver of hp, when he attempts to kamikaze you but just ends up blowing a short fuse and blows himself up and flings out of the battle (and consequently dies)
